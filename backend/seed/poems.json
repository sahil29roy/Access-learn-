    "content": "I wandered lonely as a cloud\nThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\nA host, of golden daffodils;\nBeside the lake, beneath the trees,\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\nContinuous as the stars that shine\nAnd twinkle on the milky way,\nThey stretched in never-ending line\nAlong the margin of a bay:\nTen thousand saw I at a glance,\nTossing their heads in sprightly dance.\n\nThe waves beside them danced; but they\nOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:\nA poet could not but be gay,\nIn such a jocund company:\nI gazed—and gazed—but little thought\nWhat wealth the show to me had brought:\n\nFor oft, when on my couch I lie\nIn vacant or in pensive mood,\nThey flash upon that inward eye\nWhich is the bliss of solitude;\nAnd then my heart with pleasure fills,\nAnd dances with the daffodils.",
